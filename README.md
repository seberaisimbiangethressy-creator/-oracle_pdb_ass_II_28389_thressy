creation of  a New Pluggable Database (PDB)

## Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database

In this task, I created a new Pluggable Database (PDB) using the exact 
naming convention provided in the assignment instructions.

The PDB named th_pdb_2024101 was successfully created and opened in 
READ WRITE mode as required. Its state was also saved to ensure that 
it automatically opens whenever the database starts.

Inside this PDB, I created a user named 
thressy_plsqlauca_2024101 following the specified username format 
given in the assignment.

This user will be used for all future class work as instructed. 
The required privileges were granted to allow the user to connect 
and work within the PDB.

## Task 2: Temporary PDB Creation and Deletion

In this task, I created a temporary pluggable database using the required naming convention provided in the assignment instructions. After creating the temporary PDB, I verified that it was successfully created by checking the list of available pluggable databases.

Once I confirmed its existence, I opened the temporary PDB and later closed it in order to proceed with the deletion process. I then deleted the temporary PDB completely including its associated datafiles from the system.

Finally, I confirmed that the temporary PDB was successfully removed by displaying the list of pluggable databases again to ensure that it no longer appeared in the environment.

##Task 3: Oracle Enterprise Manager

Oracle Enterprise Manager was configured and accessed successfully.
The dashboard displayed the Oracle environment and created PDB.
