## Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database

In this task, I created a new Pluggable Database (PDB) using the exact 
naming convention provided in the assignment instructions.

The PDB named th_pdb_2024101 was successfully created and opened in 
READ WRITE mode as required. Its state was also saved to ensure that 
it automatically opens whenever the database starts.

Inside this PDB, I created a user named 
thressy_plsqlauca_2024101 following the specified username format 
given in the assignment.

This user will be used for all future class work as instructed. 
The required privileges were granted to allow the user to connect 
and work within the PDB.
